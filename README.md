# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game

## Overview
A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI opponent with multiple difficulty levels. The AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm, designed to make optimal decisions, providing a challenging and fun experience for the player.Install it on your device for an app‑like experience, complete with offline support.

## Game Features
* Minimax Algorithm: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to simulate a perfect opponent. It recursively evaluates all possible moves and chooses the one that minimizes the player's potential to win.
* Interactive UI: The game board is made up of 9 cells that the player can click to make a move. The board updates in real-time, showing X or O as players make their moves.
* Difficulty Options: The user can choose between 3 difficulties Easy, Medium and Hard and based on the difficulty level the AI will play.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5 – Structure of the game interface.
* CSS3 – Styling for a simple and responsive design.
* JavaScript (Vanilla) – Logic for the game, including Minimax AI implementation, game state management, and event handling.
* Web App Manifest & Service Worker for offline support and installability.
