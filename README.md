# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game

## Overview
A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI opponent. The AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm, designed to make optimal decisions, providing a challenging and fun experience for the player.

## Game Features
* Minimax Algorithm: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to simulate a perfect opponent. It recursively evaluates all possible moves and chooses the one that minimizes the player's potential to win.
* Interactive UI: The game board is made up of 9 cells that the player can click to make a move. The board updates in real-time, showing X or O as players make their moves.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5 – Structure of the game interface.
* CSS3 – Styling for a simple and responsive design.
* JavaScript (Vanilla) – Logic for the game, including Minimax AI implementation, game state management, and event handling.
